#### Hello World

- Its a simple beginner extension.

#### Reading Time

- This extension adds the expected reading time to any Chrome extension and Chrome Web Store documentation page.
- The extension will first check if the page contains the <article> element. Then, it will count all the words within this element and create a paragraph that displays the total reading time.

#### Focus Mode

- This extension simplifies the styling of the Chrome extension and Chrome Web Store documentation pages so that they are easier to read by removing nav bar and side bars.
